# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a customer churn prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Customer churn is a critical metric for understanding why and how customers are leaving a business, and predicting this can help in implementing strategies to retain them.

## Project Overview
### Model Development:

We use the Telecom Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle to build a deep learning model for predicting customer churn. The model is developed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
### Model Evaluation:
We evaluate the model's performance using key metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. Additionally, we utilize a confusion matrix and a classification report to get deeper insights into the model's effectiveness and to understand its prediction capabilities.
